# Machine learning for epileptic state classification
These codes are including preprocessing algorithms for signal analysis as well as four conventional machine learning (support vector machines, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and boosting) and two classic deep learning (convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network) algorithms for epileptic state classification.
